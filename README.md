# University
This repository contains all of the material downloaded or created for the university (Bachelor's Degree on Computer Science, started in 2022 at "Universit√† degli Studi di Catania") until now.

Most of the material is in italian. I don't guarantee all the work is correct.

You will mainly find .pdf, .xopp (Xournal++) and .md files.
The markdown files are written in Obsidian, I'm sorry if you can't properly render all of the files content; I plan in future to share my obsidian extensions so that you can view everything right.

### Why I'm sharing this material

I've written everything just for myself (just to study), didn't really plan to make all of this public.

The main reason I'm choosing to share this material is that some people has asked me to send them some subjects' content. Having this space allows me to redirect them in this repository instead of zippping and sending the files or folders individually.

### Folders Structure

Every folder name containts the subject name with a prefix of four digits which mean:
- The first digit refers to the year of the subjet
- The second digit refers to the semester of the subject
- The third and fourth digits refer to the subject id (which I randomly set)

### My Google Sheet

I track all my marks and exams in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fZZPt1zc6c_K6VdMn6nS60H-tv2VyBzxq3R2oebD4-A).
I take this opportunity to share it since I'm proud of how it came out. Feel free to copy it and make it yours.

### Contribution

I'm open to errors reports, if you find any I'll correct them as soon as possible.
